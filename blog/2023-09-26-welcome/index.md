After building apps for other companies, I decided to build my own.

I spent two months researching and testing ideas.

Compass was the one I and others were most excited about.

I built a Figma prototype and showed it to more potential users. They liked it.

Then I built a working prototype by extending an open-source calendar (Full Calendar) and added a few conceptual features.

People liked the concepts, but they said the UX needed to be a lot better.

Then I built a calendar from scratch, which took 2 years of on-and-off work.

I open-sourced everything in Sept 2023.

I explain the reason for doing this in [this post on my personal site](https://www.tylerdane.com/post/why-i-open-sourced-my-calendar-app-after-2-years).
