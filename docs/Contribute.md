# How to Contribute

## Setting Expectations

I've been both a thankless contributor and an overwhelmed maintainer. I don't want that to happen to you here, so I'm sharing more context about me and the project. I hope this helps you decide on your level of investment.

From Fall 2023 - Spring 2024, I'll be working with a client full-time as a Software Engineer. My off-hours creative work will be spent making high-quality YouTube videos. I may carve out a few hours here and there to work on Compass, but I don't expect to make much progress. I don't know what I'll do after the contract ends.

That means that my responsiveness to PRs and GitHub issues will likely be inconsistent.

I'm open to bringing on co-maintainers, but only after we've worked collaborated on the project for some time.

For that reason, I suggest viewing the Compass repository as a live boilerplate / template rather than a steady project. It provides the foundation for a calendar app, which you can use to reference or fork. It solves a lot of the headaches that come with launching a production-ready calendar app. That said, it still has many limitations and imperfections.

If you're still interested in making the project better, thank you in advance!! Although I can't promise consistency, I'll always appreciate and credit your contributions.
