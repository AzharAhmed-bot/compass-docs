# How to Contribute

If you'd like to make a small change to Compass, feel free to simply submit a pull request.

If you'd like to contribute a larger feature or fix, please create a GitHub issue to discuss the change before submitting a pull request.

This will ensure that we're on the same page and that your work will be accepted.

Long-term, I'd like to create a public GitHub roadmap that anyone can use to autonomously decide what to work on. But for now, I'm keeping things simple.
